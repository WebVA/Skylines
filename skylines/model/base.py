# There are two convenient ways for you to spare some typing.
# You can have a query property on all your model classes by doing this:
# DeclarativeBase.query = DBSession.query_property()
# Or you can use a session-aware mapper as it was used in TurboGears 1:
# DeclarativeBase = declarative_base(mapper=DBSession.mapper)

# Global metadata.
# The default metadata is the one from the declarative base.
